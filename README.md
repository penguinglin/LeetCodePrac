# LeetCode Practice

This README details my journey of practicing LeetCode problems. Starting with the Explorer's easy-level problems, and reviewing data structures and exploring various algorithmic approaches. My goal is to practice implementing solutions in multiple programming languages, primarily `Java` and `C++`, with additional exercises in `C` and `Python`.

*Note: As my learning of `Python` and `Java` occurred simultaneously, my proficiency in their syntax might not be as refined. To seasoned experts, I kindly request your patience and understanding.*
